[31mCMake Error at /usr/local/share/cv_bridge/cmake/export_cv_bridgeExport.cmake:79 (message):
  The imported target "cv_bridge::cv_bridge" references the file

     "/usr/local/lib/libcv_bridge.so"

  but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

  * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

  * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/usr/local/share/cv_bridge/cmake/export_cv_bridgeExport.cmake"
